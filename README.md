## Hackathon Info
From [DandyHacks Website](https://dandyhacks.net/index.html): DandyHacks is the University of Rochester’s annual 42-hour long hackathon. This year will be our 10th anniversary, and we’re so excited to hold this amazing milestone in-person! As a fully student-led organization at a tier 1 research university, we embody our school’s values, encouraging participants to question the world and learn more.

## Story
You are the head guinea pig creating your new home after humankind nuked Earth into oblivion. As your motherball lands on an unknown planet it is up to you and your fellow guinea pigs to terraform the planet and build a thriving community. From your small stock of seeds and food, you will grow your community into a successful civilization...

## The Program Itself
Written entirely in processing. The Linux version definitely works but the Windows version seems to have some issues. It's easier to compile/run from source with Processing.

**UPDATE** [You can now play the game on my website](https://ryanrosenblatt.com/planet-guinea-pig/#game)
